# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pythman (python and pacman)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that serves like pacman but I will make it my own. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will conduct a game that the user can play. The features will be a pacman style game. The player will play the game like a tradinatial pacman game where they have
to hide from the predators while trying to win the game. It will be excuated through python. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051,
###and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project is that it effectivly works. No matter what I willl accomplish making a pacman game. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project is that people who play my game will enjoy it and want to play it again. I think that I can accomplish a game that not only works but one that
others will enjoy playing. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my project is that I can figure out a way to redesign the pacman board and make my own with pictures and colors. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates,
###who will do what?

My next steps are I am going to look at some code of other games so I can fully understand what type of style and format I need to code. So that I can efficently code the game
in a way that is orgainzed and formatted in a orderly fashion. The skills I need to accquire is becoming more comfortable with coding long lines of text (code) so I dont
get over whellmed. I am going to research different ways to implment my game and how to create my icons and character to put into the game. I want to create a pacman style
game not the same thing as pacman that would not be fun or orginal in the slightest.
