For my final project I made a game called "pythman". It is a game that combines the games pacman and snake. 


## Difficulties I Faced
The first difficulty I faced was I tried to make my own shape for a python turtle. I wanted to have a snake icon as the enemies in the game. I had an image and everything ready. I was able to implement the snakes into my code but I kept getting errors and the snake icon would not move correctly. Therefore I resorted to using a turtle which I think fits well, because the turtle snake is commonly used. The second difficulty was figuring out the correct dimensions. In the end I created the correct dimensions but it was a work in progress. 



## What I learned
I learned alot from the project. First off I learned how to take all the skills that I learned from this class and put those skills into one project. I learned how to create a game that effectively works using turtle. I have used turtle a lot this year for various different labs and reasons. It was cool to create a game with it, which is something I have not done before. I also learned how to correctly work with dimensions. 



## Overall Thoughts 
I enjoyed creating the game. I wish that I could have had the snakes but I like the turtle icons as well. I like how I used the concept of pacman and snake together to create a game. I love playing games that people have coded so I really enjoyed creating my own and learning how and what it takes to create a game.
