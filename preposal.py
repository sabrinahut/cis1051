# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I would like to make some kind of game. The three ideas I have currently are my own spin on battle ship or pacman. I also have a idea of a program that would have you type for a certain amount and from there it can calculate how fast you type and rate you. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

At the moment I dont have plants to collaborate with a classmate.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No, currently I do not have any questions.
