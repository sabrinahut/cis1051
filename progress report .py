#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created the main basis for it I have the pacman figure created and I have the background. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to create the ghosts. I plan on not using ghost figures and making something else like a turtle from python or something similar. I am having difficulty creating
the ghosts (turtles) it is more complicated than I thought with the coordinates and such. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having problems with creating the correct coordinates so the game can be played efficently.
